        <h1>Mission Statement:</h1>
            <h2>- Target Audience -</h2>
            <p>Beginner musicians Learning 
                about the basics of scale 
                patters and intervals </p>
            <h2>- Problem being solved -</h2>
            <p>The user imputs any note to
                use as the tonic, as well as 
                the type of scale, and the 
                program outputs all the notes
                of that scale as well as other
                useful information like chords</p>
            <h2>- Why it will be useful -</h2>
            <p>This will help any new musicians
                understand the patters and theory
                of different scales. As a beginner
                musician, I had trouble for a while
                understanding how scale patterns work,
                and I believe this will help.</p>
